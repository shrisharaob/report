The primary objective was to explore and search for patterns in the single and population place cell activity which help in understanding the mechanisms of sequential place cell activity during different behavioural states. Initially the single place cell properties across similar and different environments was characterized.  \\
Some of the results listed lack conclusive evidence in due to insufficient data, especially stable place cells. 

\section{Single cell}
\subsection*{The place cells maintain their firing rates across multiple sessions in the same environment}

It was observed that the firing rate of place cells in is reliable across multiple sessions in the same environment. It would be expected that the cells with higher firing rates have comparable firing rates across multiple exposure of the animal to the same environment, if higher firing rates imply a stable representation. 

\subsection*{The neural representation of spatial information is sparse[stats?]}

\subsection*{Place cells have multiple spatial receptive fields}

When an animal is introduced to a familiar environment the network has to identify the reference frame from the sensory cues available and the previously learnt associations. The population population activity would be very informative of how this is achieved.
