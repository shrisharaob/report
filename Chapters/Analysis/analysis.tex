\subsection{Selection pf pyramidal cells}
The pyramidal cells were selected base on spike features and firing rate. 
Then a gaussian mixture was fit to compute class probabilities.

\subsection{Cluster Quality}

\subsection{Computing place field}
The arena was divided into 50 x 50 spatial bins. The rate maps were computed by accumulating the spikes fired by into these spatial bins, which was then normalized by the occupancy time in each bin.
