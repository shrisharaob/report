\chapter{Discussion}

The network dynamics of the brain and its sub-systems is inherently non-linear, which might provide additional layers of complexity required to achieve cognition in a purely material substrate. The neural networks of the brain are endowed with the capability to generate reliable activity patterns without any external stimulus. These internally self generated patterns put constraints on how the network behaves when external stimuli are presented. This was the underlying framework for this study. The experimental studies in the hippocampus have shown several phenomena that are internally generated. The hippocampus is also the center for spatial information processing. The discovery of place cells \cite{O'Keefe1971a} lead to the subsequent \emph{Cognitive Map hypothesis} \cite{Street}. Since then, a lot of studies have been conducted to understand the mechanisms for the formation of the spatial representation in the hippocampus. One of the predominant open questions has been - whether the spatial representation is innate or if the external stimuli is an absolutely necessary prerequisite for its formation. To solve this puzzle, it is necessary to first characterize the relevant dynamics in the hippocampus. Certain aspects of spatial processing in the hippocampus was the focus of this thesis in anticipation of discovery of interesting structure in the dynamics of the hippocampal sub-networks. 

Due to the lack of statistically sufficient number of stable place fields with single place fields in the 2D arena, some of the questions posed could not be conclusively answered. 

It was found that the network activity on the whole remains at a level that is maintained throughout the periods of exploration, which is perhaps the biologically imposed homeostasis. At the single cell level this means that when some of the cells increase their firing rate, other cells are forced to reduce their firing rates. \\
Single cells with smaller firing rates show higher variance in their firing rates. The place cells with higher firing rates are expected to have lower variance in their firing rates, supposing that the magnitude of firing rate is an indicator of a stronger association to a salient location. Although not a lot of place cells with higher firing rates were available to test this idea.\\

The pairwise analysis was performed with the intention of quantifying invariant features of pairs of place cells expressed either in their firing activity or their spatial receptive fields. In one dimensional tracks it has been shown 

to reveal how the relative firing characteristics of pairs of place cells with overlapping place fields in atleast one of  two or more distinct environments.

Since 2 dimensional environments are closer to the spatial layout in the natural world, the place cells in 2D arena was analyzed in this study. The population activity in the CA3 and CA1 were analysed
