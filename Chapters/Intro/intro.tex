One of the striking features of the brain is its ability to generate self organized activity without the necessary interaction with its of external environment. Although this fact by itself does not imply any functional role played by the self generated activity, it certainly rules out the possibility of completely understanding the brain and its subsystems in a simple stimulus - response paradigm. The task of deducing the mechanisms and computations performed in the sub-structures and  the brain as a whole, would greatly benefit from an approach that examines the brain from an inside-out perspective. This approach would attempt to investigate the internal states that extensively influence the behavior of the system under scrutiny. These internal states constrain the behavior of the system when it is interacting with its surroundings and also when the system is isolated from its environment. These internal states might actually be essential for performing the computations required for the appropriate functioning of the system. \\
The \emph{Hippocampus} is a structure of the brain that is the focal point of all converging sensory inputs. It presents an ideal window into the internal network dynamics of the brain, far away from the primary somatosensory areas. The hippocampus has been the focus of study
