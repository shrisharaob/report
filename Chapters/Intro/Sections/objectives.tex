\section{Objectives}
[INCOMPLETE]
This study was aimed at characterizing the spatio-temporal dynamics of place cells. Most of the phenomena of have been confirmed on linear tracks. The place cells in 2D arena was analyzed in this study.\st{find evidence for the existence of attractors in the hippocampal network. 
search for the computational algorithms used in the hippocampus and its supporting structures for path integration and episodic memory. how well does the data agree with the existing models of path integration and remapping}
