\section{Objectives}
[INCOMPLETE]\st{
This study was aimed at characterizing the spatio-temporal dynamics of the hippocampal network. The place cell activity dynamics across multiple environments were investigated. How do the firing 


Since 2 dimensional environments are closer to the spatial layout in the natural world, the place cells in 2D arena was analyzed in this study. The population activity in the CA3 and CA1 were analysed 


 The place cells in 2D arena was analyzed in this study.}\st{find evidence for the existence of attractors in the hippocampal network. 
search for the computational algorithms used in the hippocampus and its supporting structures for path integration and episodic memory. how well does the data agree with the existing models of path integration and remapping}
