\section{Anatomy}
The hippocampal formation has been identified to be composed of several regions based on their cytoarchitecture. These are Dentate Gyrus, CA3, CA1, Subiculum, Entorhinal cortex, pre and para Subiculum. Sensory information from different modalities converges onto the hippocampus via the Entorihnal cortex and the reciprocal divergent connections from the hippocampus to the neocortex also pass through the EC. EC sends projections to DG and CA1 through the perforant pathway. DG sends mossy fibers to CA3. CA3 projects to CA1 through the Schaffer collaterals. CA3 has massive reccurent connections with other pyramidal cells in the same area. CA1 projects to EC, via projections to deep layers.
