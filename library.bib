abstract = {Understanding how the hippocampus processes information critical for establishing spatial and declarative memories will benefit greatly from determining not only what kind of information the hippocampus registers, but also how this information is processed across the different hippocampal subfields. We addressed this question using a novel immediate-early gene-based brain-imaging method (Arc/H1a catFISH) that allows comparisons of neuronal ensembles activated by two experiences separated by approximately 30 min. Rats exposed to the same environment twice activated CA3 and CA1 ensembles with a similarly high degree of overlap. Changing the identity or configuration of local cues, or changing distal cues, activated CA3 and CA1 ensembles with reduced overlap. Yet, the overlap was greater in CA3 than in CA1. In contrast, rats exposed to two completely different environments activated CA3 and CA1 ensembles with low overlap, and this overlap was even lower in CA3 compared with CA1. Thus, CA3 has a discontinuous, whereas CA1 has a graded, population response to alterations of an environment. Additionally, as indicated by the percentage of active neurons, the context representation was more sparse in CA3 (approximately 18\%) than in CA1 (approximately 35\%). Finally, CA3 and CA1 activity levels were not correlated within a session, arguing against a simple coactivation of these regions. Instead, the within-rat ratio of CA3/CA1 cell activity was correlated across sessions, suggesting that the balance of CA3/CA1 activity is individual specific. Taken together, these findings suggest that CA3 and CA1 neuronal ensembles perform distinct, yet complementary, functions in the processing of spatial and contextual information.},

abstract = {The autoassociative memory model of hippocampal field CA3 postulates that Hebbian associations among external input features produce attractor states embedded in a recurrent synaptic matrix. In contrast, the attractor-map model postulates that a two-dimensional continuum of attractor states is preconfigured in the network during development and that transitions among these states are governed primarily by self-motion information ("path-integration"), giving rise to the strong spatial characteristic of hippocampal activity. In this model, learned associations between "coordinates" on the attractor map and external cues can result in abrupt jumps between states, in the case of mismatches between the current input and previous associations between internal coordinates and external landmarks. Both models predict attractor dynamics, but for fundamentally different reasons; however, the two models are not a priori mutually exclusive. We contrasted these two models by comparing the dynamics of state transitions when two previously learned environmental shapes were morphed between their endpoints, in animals that had first experienced the environments either at the same location, or at two different locations, connected by a passageway through which they walked. As predicted from attractor-map theory, the latter animals expressed abrupt transitions between representations at the midpoint of the morph series. Contrary to the predictions of autoassociation theory, the former group expressed no evidence of attractor dynamics during the morph series; there was only a gradual transition between endpoints. The results of this critical test thus cast the autoassociator theory for CA3 into doubt and indicate the need for a new theory for this structure.},

abstract = { Attractor networks are a popular computational construct used to
model different brain systems. These networks allow elegant computations
that are thought to represent a number of aspects of brain function.
Although there is good reason to believe that the brain displays
attractor dynamics, it has proven difficult to test experimentally
whether any particular attractor architecture resides in any particular
brain circuit. We review models and experimental evidence for three
systems in the rat brain that are presumed to be components of the
rat's navigational and memory system. Head-direction cells have been
modeled as a ring attractor, grid cells as a plane attractor, and
place cells both as a plane attractor and as a point attractor. Whereas
the models have proven to be extremely useful conceptual tools, the
experimental evidence in their favor, although intriguing, is still
mostly circumstantial. },

abstract = {The hippocampus, a critical brain structure for navigation, context-dependent learning and episodic memory, is composed of anatomically heterogeneous subregions. These regions differ in their anatomical inputs as well as in their internal circuitry. A major feature of the CA3 region is its recurrent collateral circuitry, by which the CA3 pyramidal cells make excitatory synaptic contacts on each other. In contrast, pyramidal cells in the CA1 region are not extensively interconnected. Although these differences have inspired numerous theoretical models of differential processing capacities of these two regions, there have been few reports of robust differences in the firing properties of CA1 and CA3 neurons in behaving animals. The most extensively studied of these properties is the spatially selective firing of hippocampal 'place cells'. Here we report that in a dynamically changing environment, in which familiar landmarks on the behavioural track and along the wall are rotated relative to each other, the population representation of the environment is more coherent between the original and cue-altered environments in CA3 than in CA1. These results demonstrate a functional heterogeneity between the place cells of CA3 and CA1 at the level of neural population representations.},

In multi-channel recordings, each spike waveform is discriminated in a high-dimensional space, making traditional measures of unit quality inapplicable. We describe two measures of unit isolation quality, Lratio and Isolation Distance, and evaluate their performance using simulations and tetrode recordings. Both measures quantified how well separated the spikes of one cluster (putative neuron) were from other spikes recorded simultaneously on the same multi-channel electrode. In simulations and tetrode recordings, both Lratio and Isolation Distance discriminated well- and poorly-separated clusters. In data sets from the rodent hippocampus in which neurons were simultaneously recorded intracellularly and extracellularly, values of Isolation Distance and Lratio were related to the correct identification of spikes.},

abstract = {Head-direction cells have frequently been regarded as an internal 'compass' that can be used for navigation, although there is little evidence showing a link between their activity and spatial behavior. In a navigational task requiring the use of internal cues to return to a home location without vision (path integration), we found a robust correlation between head-direction cell activity and the rat's heading error in the rat's homing behavior. We observed two different correction processes that rats used to improve performance after an error. The more frequent one consists of 'resetting' the cell whenever the rat returns to the home location. However, we found that when large errors occur, the head-direction system has the ability to 'remap' and set a new reference frame, which is then used in subsequent trials. We also offer some insight into how these two correction processes operate when rats make an error.},

abstract = {Dynamical modeling of neural systems and brain functions has a history of success over the last half century. This includes, for example, the explanation and prediction of some features of neural rhythmic behaviors. Many interesting dynamical models of learning and memory based on physiological experiments have been suggested over the last two decades. Dynamical models even of consciousness now exist. Usually these models and results are based on traditional approaches and paradigms of nonlinear dynamics including dynamical chaos. Neural systems are, however, an unusual subject for nonlinear dynamics for several reasons: (i) Even the simplest neural network, with only a few neurons and synaptic connections, has an enormous number of variables and control parameters. These make neural systems adaptive and flexible, and are critical to their biological function. (ii) In contrast to traditional physical systems described by well-known basic principles, first principles governing the dynamics of neural systems are unknown. (iii) Many different neural systems exhibit similar dynamics despite having different architectures and different levels of complexity. (iv) The network architecture and connection strengths are usually not known in detail and therefore the dynamical analysis must, in some sense, be probabilistic. (v) Since nervous systems are able to organize behavior based on sensory inputs, the dynamical modeling of these systems has to explain the transformation of temporal information into combinatorial or combinatorial-temporal codes, and vice versa, for memory and recognition. In this review these problems are discussed in the context of addressing the stimulating questions: What can neuroscience learn from nonlinear dynamics, and what can nonlinear dynamics learn from neuroscience?},

abstract = {Neuronal firing pattern, which includes both the frequency and the timing of action potentials, is a key component of information processing in the brain. Although the relationship between neuronal output (the firing pattern) and function (during a task/behavior) is not fully understood, there is now considerable evidence that a given neuron can show very different firing patterns according to brain state. Thus, such neurons assembled into neuronal networks generate different rhythms (e.g., theta, gamma and sharp wave ripples), which sign specific brain states (e.g., learning, sleep). This implies that a given neuronal network, defined by its hard-wired physical connectivity, can support different brain state-dependent activities through the modulation of its functional connectivity. Here, we review data demonstrating that not only the firing pattern, but also the functional connections between neurons, can change dynamically. We then explore the possible mechanisms of such versatility, focusing on the intrinsic properties of neurons and the properties of the synapses they establish, and how they can be modified by neuromodulators, i.e., the different ways that neurons can use to switch from one mode of communication to the other.},

abstract = {When rats forage for randomly dispersed food in a high walled cylinder the firing of their hippocampal "place" cells exhibits little dependence on the direction faced by the rat. On radial arm mazes and similar tasks, place cells are strongly directionally selective within their fields. These tasks differ in several respects, including the visual environment, configuration of the traversable space, motor behavior (e.g., linear and angular velocities), and behavioral context (e.g., presence of specific, consistent goal locations within the environment). The contributions of these factors to spatial and directional tuning of hippocampal neurons was systematically examined in rats performing several tasks in either an enriched or a sparse visual environment, and on different apparati. Place fields were more spatially and directionally selective on a radial maze than on an open, circular platform, regardless of the visual environment. On the platform, fields were more directional when the rat searched for food at fixed locations, in a stereotypic and directed manner, than when the food was scattered randomly. Thus, it seems that place fields are more directional when the animal is planning or following a route between points of special significance. This might be related to the spatial focus of the rat's attention (e.g., a particular reference point). Changing the behavioral task was also accompanied by a change in firing location in about one-third of the cells. Thus, hippocampal neuronal activity appears to encode a complex interaction between locations, their significance and the behaviors the rat is called upon to execute.},

Driven by a thalamic gamma oscillator and initially independent of cortical inhibition, EGOs synchronize neurons in a single thalamic barreloid and corresponding cortical barrel and support plasticity at developing thalamocortical synapses. We propose that the multiple replay of sensory input in thalamocortical circuits during EGOs allows thalamic and cortical neurons to be organized into vertical topographic functional units before the development of horizontal binding in adult brain.},

abstract = {Wang, Xiao-Jing. Calcium coding and adaptive temporal computation
in cortical pyramidal neurons. J. Neurophysiol. 79: 1549–1566, 1998.
In this work, we present a quantitative theory of temporal spike-frequency
adaptation in cortical pyramidal cells. Our model pyramidal neuron
has two-compartments (a “soma” and a “dendrite”) with a voltage-gated
Ca2+ conductance (g Ca) and a Ca2+-dependent K+ conductance (g AHP)
located at the dendrite or at both compartments. Its frequency-current
relations are comparable with data from cortical pyramidal cells,
and the properties of spike-evoked intracellular [Ca2+] transients
are matched with recent dendritic [Ca2+] imaging measurements. Spike-frequency
adaptation in response to a current pulse is characterized by an
adaptation time constant $\tau$adap and percentage adaptation of spike
frequency F adap [\% (peak − steady state)/peak]. We show how $\tau$adap
and F adap can be derived in terms of the biophysical parameters
of the neural membrane and [Ca2+] dynamics. Two simple, experimentally
testable, relations between $\tau$adap and F adap are predicted. The dependence
of $\tau$adap and F adap on current pulse intensity, electrotonic coupling
between the two compartments, g AHP as well the [Ca2+] decay time
constant $\tau$Ca, is assessed quantitatively. In addition, we demonstrate
that the intracellular [Ca2+] signal can encode the instantaneous
neuronal firing rate and that the conductance-based model can be
reduced to a simple calcium-model of neuronal activity that faithfully
predicts the neuronal firing output even when the input varies relatively
rapidly in time (tens to hundreds of milliseconds). Extensive simulations
have been carried out for the model neuron with random excitatory
synaptic inputs mimicked by a Poisson process. Our findings include
1) the instantaneous firing frequency (averaged over trials) shows
strong adaptation similar to the case with current pulses; 2) when
the g AHP is blocked, the dendritic g Ca could produce a hysteresis
phenomenon where the neuron is driven to switch randomly between
a quiescent state and a repetitive firing state. The firing pattern
is very irregular with a large coefficient of variation of the interspike
intervals (ISI CV > 1). The ISI distribution shows a long tail but
is not bimodal. 3) By contrast, in an intrinsically bursting regime
(with different parameter values), the model neuron displays a random
temporal mixture of single action potentials and brief bursts of
spikes. Its ISI distribution is often bimodal and its power spectrum
has a peak. 4) The spike-adapting current I AHP, as delayed inhibition
through intracellular Ca2+ accumulation, generates a “forward masking”
effect, where a masking input dramatically reduces or completely
suppresses the neuronal response to a subsequent test input. When
two inputs are presented repetitively in time, this mechanism greatly
enhances the ratio of the responses to the stronger and weaker inputs,
fulfilling a cellular form of lateral inhibition in time. 5) The
[Ca2+]-dependent I AHP provides a mechanism by which the neuron unceasingly
adapts to the stochastic synaptic inputs, even in the stationary
state following the input onset. This creates strong negative correlations
between output ISIs in a frequency-dependent manner, while the Poisson
input is totally uncorrelated in time. Possible functional implications
of these results are discussed.},

abstract = {Populations of hippocampal neurons were recorded simultaneously in rats shuttling on a track between a fixed reward site at one end and a movable reward site, mounted in a sliding box, at the opposite end. While the rat ran toward the fixed site, the box was moved. The rat returned to the box in its new position. On the initial part of all journeys, cells fired at fixed distances from the origin, whereas on the final part, cells fired at fixed distances from the destination. Thus, on outward journeys from the box, with the box behind the rat, the position representation must have been updated by path integration. Farther along the journey, the place field map became aligned on the basis of external stimuli. The spatial representation was quantified in terms of population vectors. During shortened journeys, the vector shifted from an alignment with the origin to an alignment with the destination. The dynamics depended on the degree of mismatch with respect to the full-length journey. For small mismatches, the vector moved smoothly through intervening coordinates until the mismatch was corrected. For large mismatches, it jumped abruptly to the new coordinate. Thus, when mismatches occur, path integration and external cues interact competitively to control place-cell firing. When the same box was used in a different environment, it controlled the alignment of a different set of place cells. These data suggest that although map alignment can be controlled by landmarks, hippocampal neurons do not explicitly represent objects or events.},

abstract = {The hippocampus provides a spatial map of the environment. Changes in the environment alter the firing patterns of hippocampal neurons, but are presumably constrained by elements of the network dynamics. We compared the neural activity in CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus in rats running for water reward on a linear track, before and after the track length was shortened. A fraction of cells lost their place fields and new sets of cells with fields emerged, indicating distinct representation of the two tracks. Cells active in both environments shifted their place fields in a location-dependent manner, most notably at the beginning and the end of the track. Furthermore, peak firing rates and place-field sizes decreased, whereas place-field overlap and coactivity increased. Power in the theta-frequency band of the local field potentials also decreased in both CA1 and CA3, along with the coherence between the two structures. In contrast, the theta-scale (0-150 ms) time lags between cell pairs, representing distances on the tracks, were conserved, and the activity of the inhibitory neuron population was maintained across environments. We interpret these observations as reflecting the freedoms and constraints of the hippocampal network dynamics. The freedoms permit the necessary flexibility for the network to distinctly represent unique patterns, whereas the dynamics constrain the speed at which activity propagates between the cell assemblies representing the patterns.},

abstract = {A quantitative computational theory of the operation of the CA3 system as an attractor or autoassociation network is described. Based on the proposal that CA3-CA3 autoassociative networks are important for episodic or event memory in which space is a component (place in rodents and spatial view in primates), it has been shown behaviorally that the CA3 supports spatial rapid one-trial learning and learning of arbitrary associations and pattern completion where space is a component. Consistent with the theory, single neurons in the primate CA3 respond to combinations of spatial view and object, and spatial view and reward. Furthermore, single CA3 neurons reflect the recall of a place from an object in a one-trial object-place event memory task. CA3 neurons also reflect in their firing a memory of spatial view that is retained and updated by idiothetic information to implement path integration when the spatial view is obscured. Based on the computational proposal that the dentate gyrus produces sparse representations by competitive learning and via the mossy fiber pathway forces new representations on the CA3 during learning (encoding), it has been shown behaviorally that the dentate gyrus supports spatial pattern separation during learning, and that the mossy fiber system to CA3 connections are involved in learning but not in recall. The perforant path input to CA3 is quantitatively appropriate to provide the cue for recall in CA3. The concept that the CA1 recodes information from CA3 and sets up associatively learned back-projections to neocortex to allow subsequent retrieval of information to neocortex provides a quantitative account of the large number of hippocampo-neocortical back-projections.},

abstract = {Review of the normally occurring neuronal patterns of the hippocampus suggests that the two principal cell types of the hippocampus, the pyramidal neurons and granule cells, are maximally active during different behaviors. Granule cells reach their highest discharge rates during theta-concurrent exploratory activities, while population synchrony of pyramidal cells is maximum during immobility, consummatory behaviors, and slow wave sleep associated with field sharp waves. Sharp waves reflect the summed postsynaptic depolarization of large numbers of pyramidal cells in the CA1 and subiculum as a consequence of synchronous discharge of bursting CA3 pyramidal neurons. The trigger for the population burst in the CA3 region is the temporary release from subcortical tonic inhibition. An overview of the experimentally explored criteria of synaptic enhancement (intensity, frequency, and pattern of postsynaptic depolarization, calcium influx, cooperativity, threshold) suggests that these requirements may be present during sharp wave-concurrent population bursts of pyramidal cells. Experimental evidence is cited showing that (a) population bursts in CA3 may lead to long-term potentiation in their postsynaptic CA1 targets, (b) tetanizing stimuli are capable of increasing the synchrony of the sharp wave-burst, and (c) activity patterns of the neocortical input to the hippocampus determine which subgroup of CA3 neurons will trigger subsequently occurring population bursts (initiator cells). Based on the experimental evidence reviewed a formal model of memory trace formation is outlined. During exploratory (theta) behaviors the neocortical information is transmitted to the hippocampus via the fast-firing granule cells which may induce a weak and transient heterosynaptic potentiation in a subgroup of CA3 pyramidal cells. The weakly potentiated CA3 neurons will then initiate population bursts upon the termination of exploratory activity (sharp wave state). It is assumed that recurrent excitation during the population burst is strongest on those cells which initiated the population event. It is suggested that the strong excitatory drive brought about by the sharp wave-concurrent population bursts during consummatory behaviors, immobility, and slow wave sleep may be sufficient for the induction of long-term synaptic modification in the initiator neurons of the CA3 region and in their targets in CA1. In this two-stage model both exploratory (theta) and sharp wave states of the hippocampus are essential and any interference that might modify the structure of the population bursts (e.g. epileptic spikes) is detrimental to memory trace formation.},

abstract = {Grid cells in the rat entorhinal cortex display strikingly regular firing responses to the animal's position in 2-D space and have been hypothesized to form the neural substrate for dead-reckoning. However, errors accumulate rapidly when velocity inputs are integrated in existing models of grid cell activity. To produce grid-cell-like responses, these models would require frequent resets triggered by external sensory cues. Such inadequacies, shared by various models, cast doubt on the dead-reckoning potential of the grid cell system. Here we focus on the question of accurate path integration, specifically in continuous attractor models of grid cell activity. We show, in contrast to previous models, that continuous attractor models can generate regular triangular grid responses, based on inputs that encode only the rat's velocity and heading direction. We consider the role of the network boundary in the integration performance of the network and show that both periodic and aperiodic networks are capable of accurate path integration, despite important differences in their attractor manifolds. We quantify the rate at which errors in the velocity integration accumulate as a function of network size and intrinsic noise within the network. With a plausible range of parameters and the inclusion of spike variability, our model networks can accurately integrate velocity inputs over a maximum of 10100 meters and 110 minutes. These findings form a proof-of-concept that continuous attractor dynamics may underlie velocity integration in the dorsolateral medial entorhinal cortex. The simulations also generate pertinent upper bounds on the accuracy of integration that may be achieved by continuous attractor dynamics in the grid cell network. We suggest experiments to test the continuous attractor model and differentiate it from models in which single cells establish their responses independently of each other.},

We performed large-scale recordings in the dorsal hippocampus of rats to quantify the similarities and differences between CA1 (n > 3,600) and CA3 (n > 2,200) pyramidal cells during sleep and exploration in multiple environments. CA1 and CA3 neurons differed significantly in firing rates, spike burst propensity, spike entrainment by the theta rhythm, and other aspects of spiking dynamics in a brain state-dependent manner. A smaller proportion of CA3 than CA1 cells displayed prominent place fields, but place fields of CA3 neurons were more compact, more stable, and carried more spatial information per spike than those of CA1 pyramidal cells. Several other features of the two cell types were specific to the testing environment. CA3 neurons showed less pronounced phase precession and a weaker position versus spike-phase relationship than CA1 cells. Our findings suggest that these distinct activity dynamics of CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells support their distinct computational roles.},

abstract = {Fast neuronal oscillations (gamma, 20-80 Hz) have been observed in the neocortex and hippocampus during behavioral arousal. Using computer simulations, we investigated the hypothesis that such rhythmic activity can emerge in a random network of interconnected GABAergic fast-spiking interneurons. Specific conditions for the population synchronization, on properties of single cells and the circuit, were identified. These include the following: (1) that the amplitude of spike afterhyperpolarization be above the GABAA synaptic reversal potential; (2) that the ratio between the synaptic decay time constant and the oscillation period be sufficiently large; (3) that the effects of heterogeneities be modest because of a steep frequency-current relationship of fast-spiking neurons. Furthermore, using a population coherence measure, based on coincident firings of neural pairs, it is demonstrated that large-scale network synchronization requires a critical (minimal) average number of synaptic contacts per cell, which is not sensitive to the network size. By changing the GABAA synaptic maximal conductance, synaptic decay time constant, or the mean external excitatory drive to the network, the neuronal firing frequencies were gradually and monotonically varied. By contrast, the network synchronization was found to be high only within a frequency band coinciding with the gamma (20-80 Hz) range. We conclude that the GABAA synaptic transmission provides a suitable mechanism for synchronized gamma oscillations in a sparsely connected network of fast-spiking interneurons. In turn, the interneuronal network can presumably maintain subthreshold oscillations in principal cell populations and serve to synchronize discharges of spatially distributed neurons.},

abstract = {Simultaneous recordings were made from large ensembles of hippocampal "place cells" in three rats during spatial behavioral tasks and in slow-wave sleep preceding and following these behaviors. Cells that fired together when the animal occupied particular locations in the environment exhibited an increased tendency to fire together during subsequent sleep, in comparison to sleep episodes preceding the behavioral tasks. Cells that were inactive during behavior, or that were active but had non-overlapping spatial firing, did not show this increase. This effect, which declined gradually during each post-behavior sleep session, may result from synaptic modification during waking experience. Information acquired during active behavior is thus re-expressed in hippocampal circuits during sleep, as postulated by some theories of memory consolidation.},

abstract = {'Continuous attractor' neural networks can maintain a localised packet of neuronal activity representing the current state of an agent in a continuous space without external sensory input. In applications such as the representation of head direction or location in the environment, only one packet of activity is needed. For some spatial computations a number of different locations, each with its own features, must be held in memory. We extend previous approaches to continuous attractor networks (in which one packet of activity is maintained active) by showing that a single continuous attractor network can maintain multiple packets of activity simultaneously, if each packet is in a different state space or map. We also show how such a network could by learning self-organise to enable the packets in each space to be moved continuously in that space by idiothetic (motion) inputs. We show how such multi-packet continuous attractor networks could be used to maintain different types of feature (such as form vs colour) simultaneously active in the correct location in a spatial representation. We also show how high-order synapses can improve the performance of these networks, and how the location of a packet could be read by motor networks. The multiple packet continuous attractor networks described here may be used for spatial representations in brain areas such as the parietal cortex and hippocampus.},

Here we extend previous results on threshold-linear networks to a much larger class of models, by considering different connectivities (including full feedback, highly diluted and multilayer feedforward architectures), different forms of Hebbian learning rules, and different distributions of firing rates (including realistic, continuous distributions of rates). This allows an evaluation of the main factors which may affect, in real cortical networks, the capacity for storage and retrieval of discrete firing patterns. In each case a single equation is derived, which determines both $\alpha$c, the maximum number of retrievable patterns per synapse, and Im, the maximum amount of retrievable information per synapse. It is shown that: 1. Non-speeific effects, such as those usually ascribed to inhibition, or to neuramodulatary affere...},

abstract = {Gamma rhythms are commonly observed in many brain regions during both
waking and sleep states, yet their functions and mechanisms remain
a matter of debate. Here we review the cellular and synaptic mechanisms
underlying gamma oscillations and outline empirical questions and
controversial conceptual issues. Our main points are as follows:
First, gamma-band rhythmogenesis is inextricably tied to perisomatic
inhibition. Second, gamma oscillations are short-lived and typically
emerge from the coordinated interaction of excitation and inhibition,
which can be detected as local field potentials. Third, gamma rhythm
typically concurs with irregular firing of single neurons, and the
network frequency of gamma oscillations varies extensively depending
on the underlying mechanism. To document gamma oscillations, efforts
should be made to distinguish them from mere increases of gamma-band
power and/or increased spiking activity. Fourth, the magnitude of
gamma oscillation is modulated by slower rhythms. Such cross-frequency
coupling may serve to couple active patches of cortical circuits.
Because of their ubiquitous nature and strong correlation with the
"operational modes" of local circuits, gamma oscillations continue
to provide important clues about neuronal population dynamics in
health and disease.},

abstract = {A long-standing conjecture in neuroscience is that aspects of cognition depend on the brain's ability to self-generate sequential neuronal activity. We found that reliably and continually changing cell assemblies in the rat hippocampus appeared not only during spatial navigation but also in the absence of changing environmental or body-derived inputs. During the delay period of a memory task, each moment in time was characterized by the activity of a particular assembly of neurons. Identical initial conditions triggered a similar assembly sequence, whereas different conditions gave rise to different sequences, thereby predicting behavioral choices, including errors. Such sequences were not formed in control (nonmemory) tasks. We hypothesize that neuronal representations, evolved for encoding distance in spatial navigation, also support episodic recall and the planning of action sequences.},

abstract = {Five key topics have been reverberating in hippocampal-entorhinal cortex (EC) research over the past five decades: episodic and semantic memory, path integration ("dead reckoning") and landmark ("map") navigation, and theta oscillation. We suggest that the systematic relations between single cell discharge and the activity of neuronal ensembles reflected in local field theta oscillations provide a useful insight into the relationship among these terms. In rats trained to run in direction-guided (1-dimensional) tasks, hippocampal cell assemblies discharge sequentially, with different assemblies active on opposite runs, i.e., place cells are unidirectional. Such tasks do not require map representation and are formally identical with learning sequentially occurring items in an episode. Hebbian plasticity, acting within the temporal window of the theta cycle, converts the travel distances into synaptic strengths between the sequentially activated and unidirectionally connected assemblies. In contrast, place representations by hippocampal neurons in 2-dimensional environments are typically omnidirectional, characteristic of a map. Generation of a map requires exploration, essentially a dead reckoning behavior. We suggest that omnidirectional navigation through the same places (junctions) during exploration gives rise to omnidirectional place cells and, consequently, maps free of temporal context. Analogously, multiple crossings of common junction(s) of episodes convert the common junction(s) into context-free or semantic memory. Theta oscillation can hence be conceived as the navigation rhythm through both physical and mnemonic space, facilitating the formation of maps and episodic/semantic memories.},

abstract = {Memory interference is a common cause of forgetting. Interference
is a byproduct of the need to balance the formation of well-differentiated
representations against the ability to retrieve memories from cues
that are not identical to the original experience. How the brain
accomplishes this has remained elusive. Here we review how insights
can be gained from studies of an apparently unrelated phenomenon
in the rodent brain--remapping in hippocampal place cells. Remapping
refers to the formation of distinct representations in populations
of place cells after minor changes in inputs to the hippocampus.
Remapping might reflect processes involved generally in decorrelation
of overlapping signals. These processes might be crucial for storing
large numbers of similar experiences with only minimal interference.},

@article{Itskov2008,
abstract = {In rodent hippocampus, neuronal activity is organized by a 6-10 Hz
theta oscillation. The spike timing of hippocampal pyramidal cells
with respect to the theta rhythm correlates with an animal's position
in space. This correlation has been suggested to indicate an explicit
temporal code for position. Alternatively, it may be interpreted
as a byproduct of theta-dependent dynamics of spatial information
flow in hippocampus. Here we show that place cell activity on different
phases of theta reflects positions shifted into the future or past
along the animal's trajectory in a two-dimensional environment. The
phases encoding future and past positions are consistent across recorded
CA1 place cells, indicating a coherent representation at the network
level. Consistent theta-dependent time offsets are not simply a consequence
of phase-position correlation (phase precession), because they are
no longer seen after data randomization that preserves the phase-position
relationship. The scale of these time offsets, 100-300 ms, is similar
to the latencies of hippocampal activity after sensory input and
before motor output, suggesting that offset activity may maintain
coherent brain activity in the face of information processing delays.},

@article{Taube1990,
abstract = {This paper is a study of the behavioral and spatial firing correlates of neurons in the rat postsubiculum. Recordings were made from postsubicular neurons as rats moved freely throughout a cylindrical chamber, where the major cue for orientation was a white card taped to the inside wall. An automatic video/computer system monitored cell discharge while simultaneously tracking the position of 2 colored light emitting diodes (LEDs) secured to the animal's head. The animal's location was calculated from the position of one of the LEDs and head direction in the horizontal plane calculated from the relative positions of the 2 LEDs. Approximately 26\% of the cells were classified as head-direction cells because they discharged as a function of the animal's head direction in the horizontal plane, independent of the animal's behavior, location, or trunk position. For each head-direction cell, vectors drawn in the direction of maximal firing were parallel throughout the recording chamber and did not converge toward a single point. Plots of firing rate versus head direction showed that each firing-rate/head-direction function was adequately described by a triangular function. Each cell's maximum firing rate occurred at only one (the preferred) head direction; firing rates at head directions on either side of the preferred direction decreased linearly with angular deviation from the preferred direction. Results from 24 head-direction cells in 7 animals showed an equal distribution of preferred firing directions over a 360 degrees angle. The peak firing rate of head-direction cells varied from 5 to 115 spikes/sec (mean: 35). The range of head-direction angles over which discharge was elevated (directional firing range) was usually about 90 degrees, with little, if any, discharge at head directions outside this range. Quantitative analysis showed the location of the animal within the cylinder had minimal effect on directional cell firing. For each head-direction cell, the preferred direction, peak firing rate, and directional firing range remained stable for days. These results identify a new cell type that signals the animal's head direction in its environment.},

abstract = {Single-neuron recording studies have demonstrated the existence of neurons in the hippocampus which appear to encode information about the place where a rat is located, and about the place at which a macaque is looking. We describe ‘continuous attractor’ neural network models of place cells with Gaussian spatial fields in which the recurrent collateral synaptic connections between the neurons reflect the distance between two places. The networks maintain a localized packet of neuronal activity that represents the place where the animal is located. We show for two related models how the representation of the two-dimensional space in the continuous attractor network of place cells could self-organize by modifying the synaptic connections between the neurons, and also how the place being represented can be updated by idiothetic (self-motion) signals in a neural implementation of path integration.},

@article{Dragoi2011,
abstract = {During spatial exploration, hippocampal neurons show a sequential firing pattern in which individual neurons fire specifically at particular locations along the animal's trajectory (place cells). According to the dominant model of hippocampal cell assembly activity, place cell firing order is established for the first time during exploration, to encode the spatial experience, and is subsequently replayed during rest or slow-wave sleep for consolidation of the encoded experience. Here we report that temporal sequences of firing of place cells expressed during a novel spatial experience occurred on a significant number of occasions during the resting or sleeping period preceding the experience. This phenomenon, which is called preplay, occurred in disjunction with sequences of replay of a familiar experience. These results suggest that internal neuronal dynamics during resting or sleep organize hippocampal cellular assemblies into temporal sequences that contribute to the encoding of a related novel experience occurring in the future.},

@article{Fenton2008,
abstract = {In standard experimental environments, a constant proportion of CA1 principal cells are place cells, each with a spatial receptive field called a place field. Although the properties of place cells are a basis for understanding the mammalian representation of spatial knowledge, there is no consensus on which of the two fundamental neural-coding hypotheses correctly accounts for how place cells encode spatial information. Within the dedicated-coding hypothesis, the current activity of each cell is an independent estimate of the location with respect to its place field. The average of the location estimates from many cells represents current location, so a dedicated place code would degrade if single cells had multiple place fields. Within the alternative, ensemble-coding hypothesis, the concurrent discharge of many place cells is a vector that represents current location. An ensemble place code is not degraded if single cells have multiple place fields as long as the discharge vector at each location is unique. Place cells with multiple place fields might be required to represent the substantially larger space in more natural environments. To distinguish between the dedicated-coding and ensemble-coding hypotheses, we compared the characteristics of CA1 place fields in a standard cylinder and an approximately six times larger chamber. Compared with the cylinder, in the chamber, more CA1 neurons were place cells, each with multiple, irregularly arranged, and enlarged place fields. The results indicate that multiple place fields is a fundamental feature of CA1 place cell activity and that, consequently, an ensemble place code is required for CA1 discharge to accurately signal location.},

abstract = {The hippocampus has differentiated into an extensively connected recurrent stage (CA3) followed by a feed-forward stage (CA1). We examined the function of this structural differentiation by determining how cell ensembles in rat CA3 and CA1 generate representations of rooms with common spatial elements. In CA3, distinct subsets of pyramidal cells were activated in each room, regardless of the similarity of the testing enclosure. In CA1, the activated populations overlapped, and the overlap increased in similar enclosures. After exposure to a novel room, ensemble activity developed slower in CA3 than CA1, suggesting that the representations emerged independently.},

@article{Harris2003,
abstract = {Neurons can produce action potentials with high temporal precision. A fundamental issue is whether, and how, this capability is used in information processing. According to the 'cell assembly' hypothesis, transient synchrony of anatomically distributed groups of neurons underlies processing of both external sensory input and internal cognitive mechanisms. Accordingly, neuron populations should be arranged into groups whose synchrony exceeds that predicted by common modulation by sensory input. Here we find that the spike times of hippocampal pyramidal cells can be predicted more accurately by using the spike times of simultaneously recorded neurons in addition to the animals location in space. This improvement remained when the spatial prediction was refined with a spatially dependent theta phase modulation. The time window in which spike times are best predicted from simultaneous peer activity is 10-30 ms, suggesting that cell assemblies are synchronized at this timescale. Because this temporal window matches the membrane time constant of pyramidal neurons, the period of the hippocampal gamma oscillation and the time window for synaptic plasticity, we propose that cooperative activity at this timescale is optimal for information transmission and storage in cortical circuits.},

abstract = {In humans the hippocampal region of the brain is crucial for declarative or episodic memory for a broad range of materials. In contrast, there has been controversy over whether the hippocampus mediates a similarly general memory function in other species, or whether it is dedicated to spatial memory processing. Evidence for the spatial view is derived principally from the observations of 'place cells'-hippocampal neurons that fire whenever the animal is in a particular location in its environment, or when it perceives a specific stimulus or performs a specific behaviour in a particular place. We trained rats to perform the same recognition memory task in several distinct locations in a rich spatial environment and found that the activity of many hippocampal neurons was related consistently to perceptual, behavioural or cognitive events, regardless of the location where these events occurred. These results indicate that nonspatial events are fundamental elements of hippocampal representation, and support the view that, across species, the hippocampus has a broad role in information processing associated with memory.},

abstract = {Using the techniques set out in the preceding paper (Muller et al., 1987), we investigated the response of place cells to changes in the animal's environment. The standard apparatus used was a cylinder, 76 cm in diameter, with walls 51 cm high. The interior was uniformly gray except for a white cue card that ran the full height of the wall and occupied 100 degrees of arc. The floor of the apparatus presented no obstacles to the animal's motions. Each of these major features of the apparatus was varied while the others were held constant. One set of manipulations involved the cue card. Rotating the cue card produced equal rotations of the firing fields of single cells. Changing the width of the card did not affect the size, shape, or radial position of firing fields, although sometimes the field rotated to a modest extent. Removing the cue card altogether also left the size, shape, and radial positions of firing fields unchanged, but caused fields to rotate to unpredictable angular positions. The second set of manipulations dealt with the size and shape of the apparatus wall. When the standard (small) cylinder was scaled up in diameter and height by a factor of 2, the firing fields of 36\% of the cells observed in both cylinders also scaled, in the sense that the field stayed at the same angular position and at the same relative radial position. Of the cells recorded in both cylinders, 52\% showed very different firing patterns in one cylinder than in the other. The remaining 12\% of the cells were virtually silent in both cylinders. Similar results were obtained when individual cells were recorded in both a small and a large rectangular enclosure. By contrast, when the apparatus floor plan was changed from circular to rectangular, the firing pattern of a cell in an apparatus of one shape could not be predicted from a knowledge of the firing pattern in the other shape. The final manipulations involved placing vertical barriers into the otherwise unobstructed floor of the small cylinder. When an opaque barrier was set up to bisect a previously recorded firing field, in almost all cases the firing field was nearly abolished. This was true even though the barrier occupied only a small fraction of the firing field area. A transparent barrier was effective as the opaque barrier in attenuating firing fields. The lead base used to anchor the vertical barriers did not affect place cell firing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Decoding models trained on stimulus-induced brain activity in visual cortical areas showed accurate classification, detection, and identification of contents.

abstract = {During spatial exploration, hippocampal neurons show a sequential firing pattern in which individual neurons fire specifically at particular locations along the animal's trajectory (place cells). According to the dominant model of hippocampal cell assembly activity, place cell firing order is established for the first time during exploration, to encode the spatial experience, and is subsequently replayed during rest or slow-wave sleep for consolidation of the encoded experience. Here we report that temporal sequences of firing of place cells expressed during a novel spatial experience occurred on a significant number of occasions during the resting or sleeping period preceding the experience. This phenomenon, which is called preplay, occurred in disjunction with sequences of replay of a familiar experience. These results suggest that internal neuronal dynamics during resting or sleep organize hippocampal cellular assemblies into temporal sequences that contribute to the encoding of a related novel experience occurring in the future.},

abstract = {Synchronous rhythms represent a core mechanism for sculpting temporal
coordination of neural activity in the brain-wide network. This review
focuses on oscillations in the cerebral cortex that occur during
cognition, in alert behaving conditions. Over the last two decades,
experimental and modeling work has made great strides in elucidating
the detailed cellular and circuit basis of these rhythms, particularly
gamma and theta rhythms. The underlying physiological mechanisms
are diverse (ranging from resonance and pacemaker properties of single
cells to multiple scenarios for population synchronization and wave
propagation), but also exhibit unifying principles. A major conceptual
advance was the realization that synaptic inhibition plays a fundamental
role in rhythmogenesis, either in an interneuronal network or in
a reciprocal excitatory-inhibitory loop. Computational functions
of synchronous oscillations in cognition are still a matter of debate
among systems neuroscientists, in part because the notion of regular
oscillation seems to contradict the common observation that spiking
discharges of individual neurons in the cortex are highly stochastic
and far from being clocklike. However, recent findings have led to
a framework that goes beyond the conventional theory of coupled oscillators
and reconciles the apparent dichotomy between irregular single neuron
activity and field potential oscillations. From this perspective,
a plethora of studies will be reviewed on the involvement of long-distance
neuronal coherence in cognitive functions such as multisensory integration,
working memory, and selective attention. Finally, implications of
abnormal neural synchronization are discussed as they relate to mental
disorders like schizophrenia and autism.},

abstract = {The hippocampus is thought to be involved in episodic memory formation by reactivating traces of waking experience during sleep. Indeed, the joint firing of spatially tuned pyramidal cells encoding nearby places recur during sleep. We found that the sleep cofiring of rat CA1 pyramidal cells encoding similar places increased relative to the sleep session before exploration. This cofiring increase depended on the number of times that cells fired together with short latencies (<50 ms) during exploration, and was strongest between cells representing the most visited places. This is indicative of a Hebbian learning rule in which changes in firing associations between cells are determined by the number of waking coincident firing events. In contrast, cells encoding different locations reduced their cofiring in proportion to the number of times that they fired independently. Together these data indicate that reactivated patterns are shaped by both positive and negative changes in cofiring, which are determined by recent behavior.},

abstract = {Many complex spike cells in the hippocampus of the freely moving rat have as their primary correlate the animal's location in an environment (place cells). In contrast, the hippocampal electroencephalograph theta pattern of rhythmical waves (7-12 Hz) is better correlated with a class of movements that change the rat's location in an environment. During movement through the place field, the complex spike cells often fire in a bursting pattern with an interburst frequency in the same range as the concurrent electroencephalograph theta. The present study examined the phase of the theta wave at which the place cells fired. It was found that firing consistently began at a particular phase as the rat entered the field but then shifted in a systematic way during traversal of the field, moving progressively forward on each theta cycle. This precession of the phase ranged from 100 degrees to 355 degrees in different cells. The effect appeared to be due to the fact that individual cells had a higher interburst rate than the theta frequency. The phase was highly correlated with spatial location and less well correlated with temporal aspects of behavior, such as the time after place field entry. These results have implications for several aspects of hippocampal function. First, by using the phase relationship as well as the firing rate, place cells can improve the accuracy of place coding. Second, the characteristics of the phase shift constrain the models that define the construction of place fields. Third, the results restrict the temporal and spatial circumstances under which synapses in the hippocampus could be modified.},

We report two major changes in entorhinal grid cells. First, hippocampal inactivation gradually and selectively extinguished the grid pattern. Second, the same grid cells that lost their grid fields acquired substantial tuning to the direction of the rat's head. This transition in firing properties was contingent on a drop in the average firing rate of the grid cells and could be replicated by the removal of an external excitatory drive in an attractor network model in which grid structure emerges by velocity-dependent translation of activity across a network with inhibitory connections. These results point to excitatory drive from the hippocampus, and possibly other regions, as one prerequisite for the formation and translocation of grid patterns in the MEC.},

We have taken advantage of anatomical regularity of the rat hippocampus and combined multiple linear recordings and spatial discrimination techniques to separate pathway-specific LFPs with enough spatial resolution to discriminate postsynaptic regions of varying activation, and to investigate their presynaptic origin, chemical nature, and spatial extension. We identified 6 main excitatory and inhibitory LFP generators with different synaptic territories in principal cells and hippocampal subfields matching anatomical pathways. Some recognized pathways did not contribute notably to LFPs. Each showed different septo-temporal spatial modules over which the field potential fluctuations were synchronous. These modules were explained by either the strong overlap of synaptic territories of coactivated afferent neurons (e.g., CA3 clusters for CA1 Schaffer LFPs), or widespread coalescence of postsynaptic territories (granule cell somatic inhibition). We also show evidence that distinct modes of afferent synchronization generate stereotyped spatial patterns of synchronous LFPs in one pathway. Thus, studying spatial coherence of pathway-specific LFPs provides remote access to the dynamics of afferent populations.},

abstract = {Hippocampal neurons can display reliable and long-lasting sequences
of transient firing patterns, even in the absence of changing external
stimuli. We suggest that time-keeping is an important function of
these sequences, and propose a network mechanism for their generation.
We show that sequences of neuronal assemblies recorded from rat hippocampal
CA1 pyramidal cells can reliably predict elapsed time (15-20 s) during
wheel running with a precision of 0.5 s. In addition, we demonstrate
the generation of multiple reliable, long-lasting sequences in a
recurrent network model. These sequences are generated in the presence
of noisy, unstructured inputs to the network, mimicking stationary
sensory input. Identical initial conditions generate similar sequences,
whereas different initial conditions give rise to distinct sequences.
The key ingredients responsible for sequence generation in the model
are threshold-adaptation and a Mexican-hat-like pattern of connectivity
among pyramidal cells. This pattern may arise from recurrent systems
such as the hippocampal CA3 region or the entorhinal cortex. We hypothesize
that mechanisms that evolved for spatial navigation also support
tracking of elapsed time in behaviorally relevant contexts.},

abstract = {In the vast majority of brain areas, the firing rates of neurons, averaged over several hundred milliseconds to several seconds, can be strongly modulated by, and provide accurate information about, properties of their inputs. This is referred to as the rate code. However, the biophysical laws of synaptic plasticity require precise timing of spikes over short timescales (<10 ms). Hence it is critical to understand the physiological mechanisms that can generate precise spike timing in vivo, and the relationship between such a temporal code and a rate code. Here we propose a mechanism by which a temporal code can be generated through an interaction between an asymmetric rate code and oscillatory inhibition. Consistent with the predictions of our model, the rate and temporal codes of hippocampal pyramidal neurons are highly correlated. Furthermore, the temporal code becomes more robust with experience. The resulting spike timing satisfies the temporal order constraints of hebbian learning. Thus, oscillations and receptive field asymmetry may have a critical role in temporal sequence learning.},

Previous work has shown that the angular position of hippocampal place cell firing fields is accurately controlled by the position of visual cues, suggesting that vision plays a important role in triggering place cell activity. However, a role for other types of information has also been suggested because place cell activity can be recorded while animals are moving in the darkness. In this study, we asked whether place fields can get established in rats that have never seen their environment. We studied place cell activity in early blind rats and found that these rats had place cells very similar to those recorded from sighted rats. This result suggests that early vision is not necessary for normal firing of hippocampal place cells. Dynamic, motion-related information in conjunction with stimulus recognition seems to be sufficient.},

The firing pattern of a single grid cell has been hypothesized to be generated through attractor dynamics in a network with a specific local connectivity including both excitatory and inhibitory connections. However, experimental evidence supporting the presence of such connectivity among grid cells in layer II is limited. Here we report recordings from more than 600 neuron pairs in rat entorhinal slices, demonstrating that stellate cells, the principal cell type in the layer II grid network, are mainly interconnected via inhibitory interneurons. Using a model attractor network, we demonstrate that stable grid firing can emerge from a simple recurrent inhibitory network. Our findings thus suggest that the observed inhibitory microcircuitry between stellate cells is sufficient to generate grid-cell firing patterns in layer II of the medial entorhinal cortex.},

Its key unit is the 'grid cell', which is activated whenever the animal's position coincides with any vertex of a regular grid of equilateral triangles spanning the surface of the environment. Grids of neighbouring cells share a common orientation and spacing, but their vertex locations (their phases) differ. The spacing and size of individual fields increase from dorsal to ventral dMEC.

Tetrodes were implanted along the entire proximodistal axis of dorsal CA1 in rats. Data were recorded in cylinders large enough to elicit firing at more than one location in many neurons. Distal CA1 cells showed more dispersed firing and had a larger number of firing fields than proximal cells.

abstract = {A fundamental property of many associative memory networks is the ability to decorrelate overlapping input patterns before information is stored. In the hippocampus, this neuronal pattern separation is expressed as the tendency of ensembles of place cells to undergo extensive 'remapping' in response to changes in the sensory or motivational inputs to the hippocampus. Remapping is expressed under some conditions as a change of firing rates in the presence of a stable place code ('rate remapping'), and under other conditions as a complete reorganization of the hippocampal place code in which both place and rate of firing take statistically independent values ('global remapping'). Here we show that the nature of hippocampal remapping can be predicted by ensemble dynamics in place-selective grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex, one synapse upstream of the hippocampus. Whereas rate remapping is associated with stable grid fields, global remapping is always accompanied by a coordinate shift in the firing vertices of the grid cells. Grid fields of co-localized medial entorhinal cortex cells move and rotate in concert during this realignment. In contrast to the multiple environment-specific representations coded by place cells in the hippocampus, local ensembles of grid cells thus maintain a constant spatial phase structure, allowing position to be represented and updated by the same translation mechanism in all environments encountered by the animal.},

Laminar analysis of neocortical gamma bursts revealed multiple gamma oscillators of varying frequency and location, which were spatially confined and synchronized local groups of neurons. A significant fraction of putative pyramidal cells and interneurons as well as localized gamma oscillations in all recorded neocortical areas were phase biased by the hippocampal theta rhythm.

abstract = {Successful integration of advanced semiconductor devices with biological systems will accelerate basic scientific discoveries and their translation into clinical technologies. In neuroscience generally, and in optogenetics in particular, the ability to insert light sources, detectors, sensors, and other components into precise locations of the deep brain yields versatile and important capabilities. Here, we introduce an injectable class of cellular-scale optoelectronics that offers such features, with examples of unmatched operational modes in optogenetics, including completely wireless and programmed complex behavioral control over freely moving animals. The ability of these ultrathin, mechanically compliant, biocompatible devices to afford minimally invasive operation in the soft tissues of the mammalian brain foreshadow applications in other organ systems, with potential for broad utility in biomedical science and engineering.},

abstract = {Both episodic memory and spatial navigation require temporal encoding
of the relationships between events or locations. In a linear maze,
ordered spatial distances between sequential locations were represented
by the temporal relations of hippocampal place cell pairs within
cycles of theta oscillation in a compressed manner. Such correlations
could arise due to spike "phase precession" of independent neurons
driven by common theta pacemaker or as a result of temporal coordination
among specific hippocampal cell assemblies. We found that temporal
correlation between place cell pairs was stronger than predicted
by a pacemaker drive of independent neurons, indicating a critical
role for synaptic interactions and precise timing within and across
cell assemblies in place sequence representation. CA1 and CA3 ensembles,
identifying spatial locations, were active preferentially on opposite
phases of theta cycles. These observations suggest that interleaving
CA3 neuronal sequences bind CA1 assemblies representing overlapping
past, present, and future locations into single episodes.},

abstract = {O'Keefe and Recce ([1993] Hippocampus 68:317-330) have observed that
the spatially selective firing of pyramidal cells in the CA1 field
of the rat hippocampus tends to advance to earlier phases of the
electroencephalogram theta rhythm as a rat passes through the place
field of a cell. We present here a neural network model based on
integrate- and-fire neurons that accounts for this effect. In this
model, place selectivity in the hippocampus is a consequence of synaptic
interactions between pyramidal neurons together with weakly selective
external input. The phase shift of neuronal spiking arises in the
model as result of asymmetric spread of activation through the network,
caused by asymmetry in the synaptic interactions. Several experimentally
observed properties of the phase shift effect follow naturally from
the model, including 1) the observation that the first spikes a cell
fires appear near the theta phase corresponding to minimal population
activity, 2) the overall advance is less than 360 degrees, and 3)
the location of the rat within the place field of the cell is the
primary correlate of the firing phase, not the time the rat has been
in the field. The model makes several predictions concerning the
emergence of place fields during the earliest stages of exploration
in a novel environment. It also suggests new experiments that could
provide further constraints on a possible explanation of the phase
precession effect.},

abstract = {Hippocampal neural codes for different, familiar environments are thought to reflect distinct attractor states, possibly implemented in the recurrent CA3 network. A defining property of an attractor network is its ability to undergo sharp and coherent transitions between pre-established (learned) representations when the inputs to the network are changed. To determine whether hippocampal neuronal ensembles exhibit such discontinuities, we recorded in CA3 and CA1 when a familiar square recording enclosure was morphed in quantifiable steps into a familiar circular enclosure while leaving other inputs constant. We observed a gradual noncoherent progression from the initial to the final network state. In CA3, the transformation was accompanied by significant hysteresis, resulting in more similar end states than when only square and circle were presented. These observations suggest that hippocampal cell assemblies are capable of incremental plastic deformation, with incongruous information being incorporated into pre-existing representations.},

@article{Samsonovich1997,
abstract = {A minimal synaptic architecture is proposed for how the brain might
perform path integration by computing the next internal representation
of self-location from the current representation and from the perceived
velocity of motion. In the model, a place-cell assembly called a
"chart" contains a two-dimensional attractor set called an "attractor
map" that can be used to represent coordinates in any arbitrary environment,
once associative binding has occurred between chart locations and
sensory inputs. In hippocampus, there are different spatial relations
among place fields in different environments and behavioral contexts.
Thus, the same units may participate in many charts, and it is shown
that the number of uncorrelated charts that can be encoded in the
same recurrent network is potentially quite large. According to this
theory, the firing of a given place cell is primarily a cooperative
effect of the activity of its neighbors on the currently active chart.
Therefore, it is not particularly useful to think of place cells
as encoding any particular external object or event. Because of its
recurrent connections, hippocampal field CA3 is proposed as a possible
location for this "multichart" architecture; however, other implementations
in anatomy would not invalidate the main concepts. The model is implemented
numerically both as a network of integrate-and-fire units and as
a "macroscopic" (with respect to the space of states) description
of the system, based on a continuous approximation defined by a system
of stochastic differential equations. It provides an explanation
for a number of hitherto perplexing observations on hippocampal place
fields, including doubling, vanishing, reshaping in distorted environments,
acquiring directionality in a two-goal shuttling task, rapid formation
in a novel environment, and slow rotation after disorientation. The
model makes several new predictions about the expected properties
of hippocampal place cells and other cells of the proposed network.},

In a novel space, the ensemble code was initially less robust but improved rapidly with exploration. During this period, the activity of many inhibitory cells was suppressed, which suggests that new spatial information creates conditions in the hippocampal circuitry that are conducive to the synaptic modification presumed to be involved in learning. Development of a new population code for a novel environment did not substantially alter the code for a familiar one, which suggests that the interference between the two spatial representations was very small. The parallel recording methods outlined here make possible the study of the dynamics of neuronal interactions during unique behavioral events.},

A unifying property of both navigation and event memory is a requirement for dealing with temporally sequenced information. Reactivation of temporally sequenced memories for previous behavioural experiences has been reported in sleep in rats. Here we report that sequential replay occurs in the rat hippocampus during awake periods immediately after spatial experience. This replay has a unique form, in which recent episodes of spatial experience are replayed in a temporally reversed order. This replay is suggestive of a role in the evaluation of event sequences in the manner of reinforcement learning models. We propose that such replay might constitute a general mechanism of learning and memory.},

abstract = {O'Keefe and Recce [1993] Hippocampus 3:317-330 described an interaction between the hippocampal theta rhythm and the spatial firing of pyramidal cells in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus: they found that a cell's spike activity advances to earlier phases of the theta cycle as the rat passes through the cell's place field. The present study makes use of large-scale parallel recordings to clarify and extend this finding in several ways: 1) Most CA1 pyramidal cells show maximal activity at the same phase of the theta cycle. Although individual units exhibit deeper modulation, the depth of modulation of CA1 population activity is about 50\%. The peak firing of inhibitory interneurons in CA1 occurs about 60 degrees in advance of the peak firing of pyramidal cells, but different interneurons vary widely in their peak phases. 2) The first spikes, as the rat enters a pyramidal cell's place field, come 90 degrees-120 degrees after the phase of maximal pyramidal cell population activity, near the phase where inhibition is least. 3) The phase advance is typically an accelerating, rather than linear, function of position within the place field. 4) These phenomena occur both on linear tracks and in two-dimensional environments where locomotion is not constrained to specific paths. 5) In two-dimensional environments, place-related firing is more spatially specific during the early part of the theta cycle than during the late part. This is also true, to a lesser extent, on a linear track. Thus, spatial selectivity waxes and wanes over the theta cycle. 6) Granule cells of the fascia dentata are also modulated by theta. The depth of modulation for the granule cell population approaches 100\%, and the peak activity of the granule cell population comes about 90 degrees earlier in the theta cycle than the peak firing of CA1 pyramidal cells. 7) Granule cells, like pyramidal cells, show robust phase precession. 8) Cross-correlation analysis shows that portions of the temporal sequence of CA1 pyramidal cell place fields are replicated repeatedly within individual theta cycles, in highly compressed form. The compression ratio can be as much as 10:1. These findings indicate that phase precession is a very robust effect, distributed across the entire hippocampal population, and that it is likely to be inherited from the fascia dentata or an earlier stage in the hippocampal circuit, rather than generated intrinsically within CA1. It is hypothesized that the compression of temporal sequences of place fields within individual theta cycles permits the use of long-term potentiation for learning of sequential structure, thereby giving a temporal dimension to hippocampal memory traces.},

The temporal code takes the form of a phase relationship to the concurrent cycle of the hippocampal electroencephalogram theta rhythm. These two codes could each represent a different variable. However, this requires the rate and phase to vary independently, in contrast to recent suggestions that they are tightly coupled, both reflecting the amplitude of the cell's input. Here we show that the time of firing and firing rate are dissociable, and can represent two independent variables: respectively the animal's location within the place field, and its speed of movement through the field. Independent encoding of location together with actions and stimuli occurring there may help to explain the dual roles of the hippocampus in spatial and episodic memory, or may indicate a more general role of the hippocampus in relational/declarative memory.},

First, lesions of the hippocampus in humans prevent the acquisition of new episodic memories; second, activity-dependent synaptic plasticity is a prominent feature of hippocampal synapses. Given this background, the hypothesis that hippocampus-dependent memory is mediated, at least in part, by hippocampal synaptic plasticity has seemed as cogent in theory as it has been difficult to prove in practice. Here we argue that the recent development of transgenic molecular devices will encourage a shift from mechanistic investigations of synaptic plasticity in single neurons towards an analysis of how networks of neurons encode and represent memory, and we suggest ways in which this might be achieved. In the process, the hypothesis that synaptic plasticity is necessary and sufficient for information storage in the brain may finally be validated.},

abstract = {Previous studies have shown that hippocampal place fields are controlled by the salient sensory cues in the environment, in that rotation of the cues causes an equal rotation of the place fields. We trained rats to forage for food pellets in a gray cylinder with a single salient directional cue, a white card covering 90 degrees of the cylinder wall. Half of the rats were disoriented before being placed in the cylinder, in order to disrupt their internal sense of direction. The other half were not disoriented before being placed in the cylinder; for these rats, there was presumably a consistent relationship between the cue card and their internal direction sense. We subsequently recorded hippocampal place cells and thalamic head direction cells from both groups of rats as they moved in the cylinder; between some sessions the cylinder and cue card were rotated to a new direction. All rats were disoriented before recording. Under these conditions, the cue card had much weaker control over the place fields and head direction cells in the rats that had been disoriented during training than in the rats that had not been disoriented. For the former group, the place fields often rotated relative to the cue card or completely changed their firing properties between sessions. In all recording sessions, the head direction cells and place cells were strongly coupled. It appears that the strength of cue control over place cells and head direction cells depends on the rat's learned perception of the stability of the cues.},

abstract = {During pauses in exploration, ensembles of place cells in the rat
hippocampus re-express firing sequences corresponding to recent spatial
experience. Such "replay" co-occurs with ripple events: short-lasting
(approximately 50-120 ms), high-frequency (approximately 200 Hz)
oscillations that are associated with increased hippocampal-cortical
communication. In previous studies, rats exploring small environments
showed replay anchored to the rat's current location and compressed
in time into a single ripple event. Here, we show, using a neural
decoding approach, that firing sequences corresponding to long runs
through a large environment are replayed with high fidelity and that
such replay can begin at remote locations on the track. Extended
replay proceeds at a characteristic virtual speed of approximately
8 m/s and remains coherent across trains of ripple events. These
results suggest that extended replay is composed of chains of shorter
subsequences, which may reflect a strategy for the storage and flexible
expression of memories of prolonged experience.},

abstract = {An important task of the brain is to represent the outside world. It is unclear how the brain may do this, however, as it can only rely on neural responses and has no independent access to external stimuli in order to "decode" what those responses mean. We investigate what can be learned about a space of stimuli using only the action potentials (spikes) of cells with stereotyped -- but unknown -- receptive fields. Using hippocampal place cells as a model system, we show that one can (1) extract global features of the environment and (2) construct an accurate representation of space, up to an overall scale factor, that can be used to track the animal's position. Unlike previous approaches to reconstructing position from place cell activity, this information is derived without knowing place fields or any other functions relating neural responses to position. We find that simply knowing which groups of cells fire together reveals a surprising amount of structure in the underlying stimulus space; this may enable the brain to construct its own internal representations.},

@article{Skaggs1996,
abstract = {O'Keefe and Recce [1993] Hippocampus 3:317-330 described an interaction between the hippocampal theta rhythm and the spatial firing of pyramidal cells in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus: they found that a cell's spike activity advances to earlier phases of the theta cycle as the rat passes through the cell's place field. The present study makes use of large-scale parallel recordings to clarify and extend this finding in several ways: 1) Most CA1 pyramidal cells show maximal activity at the same phase of the theta cycle. Although individual units exhibit deeper modulation, the depth of modulation of CA1 population activity is about 50\%. The peak firing of inhibitory interneurons in CA1 occurs about 60 degrees in advance of the peak firing of pyramidal cells, but different interneurons vary widely in their peak phases. 2) The first spikes, as the rat enters a pyramidal cell's place field, come 90 degrees-120 degrees after the phase of maximal pyramidal cell population activity, near the phase where inhibition is least. 3) The phase advance is typically an accelerating, rather than linear, function of position within the place field. 4) These phenomena occur both on linear tracks and in two-dimensional environments where locomotion is not constrained to specific paths. 5) In two-dimensional environments, place-related firing is more spatially specific during the early part of the theta cycle than during the late part. This is also true, to a lesser extent, on a linear track. Thus, spatial selectivity waxes and wanes over the theta cycle. 6) Granule cells of the fascia dentata are also modulated by theta. The depth of modulation for the granule cell population approaches 100\%, and the peak activity of the granule cell population comes about 90 degrees earlier in the theta cycle than the peak firing of CA1 pyramidal cells. 7) Granule cells, like pyramidal cells, show robust phase precession. 8) Cross-correlation analysis shows that portions of the temporal sequence of CA1 pyramidal cell place fields are replicated repeatedly within individual theta cycles, in highly compressed form. The compression ratio can be as much as 10:1. These findings indicate that phase precession is a very robust effect, distributed across the entire hippocampal population, and that it is likely to be inherited from the fascia dentata or an earlier stage in the hippocampal circuit, rather than generated intrinsically within CA1. It is hypothesized that the compression of temporal sequences of place fields within individual theta cycles permits the use of long-term potentiation for learning of sequential structure, thereby giving a temporal dimension to hippocampal memory traces.},

@article{Zhang1998,
abstract = {Physical variables such as the orientation of a line in the visual
field or the location of the body in space are coded as activity
levels in populations of neurons. Reconstruction or decoding is an
inverse problem in which the physical variables are estimated from
observed neural activity. Reconstruction is useful first in quantifying
how much information about the physical variables is present in the
population and, second, in providing insight into how the brain might
use distributed representations in solving related computational
problems such as visual object recognition and spatial navigation.
Two classes of reconstruction methods, namely, probabilistic or Bayesian
methods and basis function methods, are discussed. They include important
existing methods as special cases, such as population vector coding,
optimal linear estimation, and template matching. As a representative
example for the reconstruction problem, different methods were applied
to multi-electrode spike train data from hippocampal place cells
in freely moving rats. The reconstruction accuracy of the trajectories
of the rats was compared for the different methods. Bayesian methods
were especially accurate when a continuity constraint was enforced,
and the best errors were within a factor of two of the information-theoretic
limit on how accurate any reconstruction can be and were comparable
with the intrinsic experimental errors in position tracking. In addition,
the reconstruction analysis uncovered some interesting aspects of
place cell activity, such as the tendency for erratic jumps of the
reconstructed trajectory when the animal stopped running. In general,
the theoretical values of the minimal achievable reconstruction errors
quantify how accurately a physical variable is encoded in the neuronal
population in the sense of mean square error, regardless of the method
used for reading out the information. One related result is that
the theoretical accuracy is independent of the width of the Gaussian
tuning function only in two dimensions. Finally, all the reconstruction
methods considered in this paper can be implemented by a unified
neural network architecture, which the brain feasibly could use to
solve related problems.},

abstract = {Temporal coding is a means of representing information by the time, as opposed to the rate, at which neurons fire. Evidence of temporal coding in the hippocampus comes from place cells, whose spike times relative to theta oscillations reflect a rat's position while running along stereotyped trajectories. This arises from the backwards shift in cell firing relative to local theta oscillations (phase precession). Here we demonstrate phase precession during place-field crossings in an open-field foraging task. This produced spike sequences in each theta cycle that disambiguate the rat's trajectory through two-dimensional space and can be used to predict movement direction. Furthermore, position and movement direction were maximally predicted from firing in the early and late portions of the theta cycle, respectively. This represents the first direct evidence of a combined representation of position, trajectory and heading in the hippocampus, organized on a fine temporal scale by theta oscillations.},

@article{Jezek2011,
abstract = {The ability to recall discrete memories is thought to depend on the formation of attractor states in recurrent neural networks. In such networks, representations can be reactivated reliably from subsets of the cues that were present when the memory was encoded, at the same time as interference from competing representations is minimized. Theoretical studies have pointed to the recurrent CA3 system of the hippocampus as a possible attractor network. Consistent with predictions from these studies, experiments have shown that place representations in CA3 and downstream CA1 tolerate small changes in the configuration of the environment but switch to uncorrelated representations when dissimilarities become larger. However, the kinetics supporting such network transitions, at the subsecond timescale, is poorly understood. Here we show in rats that instantaneous transformation of the spatial context does not change the hippocampal representation all at once but is followed by temporary bistability in the discharge activity of CA3 ensembles. Rather than sliding through a continuum of intermediate activity states, the CA3 network undergoes a short period of competitive flickering between preformed representations of the past and present environment before settling on the latter. Network flickers are extremely fast, often with complete replacement of the active ensemble from one theta cycle to the next. Within individual cycles, segregation is stronger towards the end, when firing starts to decline, pointing to the theta cycle as a temporal unit for expression of attractor states in the hippocampus. Repetition of pattern-completion processes across successive theta cycles may facilitate error correction and enhance discriminative power in the presence of weak and ambiguous input cues.},
